# This folder contains scripts that are not integral to the workings of
# the package. It’s very useful for holding the scripts that actually do
# something useful using your package. For example, if your package is
# ‘python-polygons’ a bin script might be ‘generate-triangle’.
# If the package is a web application, a bin script may be ‘run-dev-server’.
