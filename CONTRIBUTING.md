  isn't one) to explain your plan and give others a chance to discuss.

## How you can help:

You can help in multiple ways:

* Reproducing bugs reported by others: This helps us **a lot**.
* Doing code reviews on the Pull Requests from the community.
* Verifying that Pull Requests from others are working correctly.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
